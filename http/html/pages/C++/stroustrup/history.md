### Timeline
- 1979 Work on ‘‘C with Classes’’ started. The initial feature set included classes and derived classes, public/private access control, constructors and destructors, and function declara- tions with argument checking. The first library supported non-preemptive concurrent tasks and random number generators.
- 1984 ‘‘C with Classes’’ was renamed to C++. By then, C++ had acquired virtual functions, function and operator overloading, references, and the I/O stream and complex number libraries.
- 1985 First commercial release of C++ (October 14). The library included I/O streams, com- plex numbers, and tasks (non-preemptive scheduling).
- 1985 The C++ Programming Language (‘‘TC++PL,’’ October 14) [Stroustrup,1986].
- 1989 The Annotated C++ Reference Manual (‘‘the ARM’’) [Ellis,1989].
- 1991 The C++ Programming Language, Second Edition [Stroustrup,1991], presenting generic
programming using templates and error handling based on exceptions, including the
‘‘Resource Acquisition Is Initialization’’ (RAII) general resource-management idiom.
- 1997 The C++ Programming Language, Third Edition [Stroustrup,1997] introduced ISO C++, including namespaces, dynamic_cast, and many refinements of templates. The standard
library added the STL framework of generic containers and algorithms.
- 1998 ISO C++ standard [C++,1998].
- 2002 Work on a revised standard, colloquially named C++0x, started.
- 2003 A ‘‘bug fix’’ revision of the ISO C++ standard was issued. A C++ Technical Report
introduced new standard-library components, such as regular expressions, unordered con- tainers (hash tables), and resource management pointers, which later became part of C++11.
- 2006 An ISO C++ Technical Report on Performance addressed questions of cost, predictability, and techniques, mostly related to embedded systems programming [C++,2004].
- 2011 ISO C++11 standard [C++,2011]. It provided uniform initialization, move semantics, types deduced from initializers (auto), range-for, variadic template arguments, lambda expressions, type aliases, a memory model suitable for concurrency, and much more. The standard library added several components, including threads, locks, and most of the components from the 2003 Technical Report.
- 2013 The first complete C++11 implementations emerged.
- 2013 The C++ Programming Language, Fourth Edition introduced C++11.
- 2014 ISO C++14 standard [C++,2014] completing C++11 with variable templates, digit sepa-
rators, generic lambdas, and a few standard-library improvements. The first C++14
implementations were completed.
- 2015 The C++ Core Guidelines projects started [Stroustrup,2015].
- 2015 The concepts TS was approved.
- 2017 ISO C++17 standard [C++,2017] offering a diverse set of new features, including order of
evaluation guarantees, structured bindings, fold expressions, a file system library, parallel algorithms, and variant and optional types. The first C++17 implementations were com- pleted.
- 2017 The modules TS and the Ranges TS were approved.
- 2020 ISO C++20 standard (scheduled).
