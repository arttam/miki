## What is Video Transcoding?
Video transcoding, sometimes called video encoding, is the conversion from one digital encoding format to another, such as for movie data files. \
This involves translating all three elements of a digital video at the same time — the file format, the video, and the audio.

This is a vital function when a target device does not support the current format of your media, \
or has limited storage capacity that requires a reduced file size (think going from WMV to MP4). \
It is also used to convert incompatible or obsolete data to a better-supported, read newer, video format.

## How is Video Transcoding Done?
Video begins life in a format unique to the camera or program used to capture your images and sounds. \
This is typically not the format needed to deliver the video online or play it from another device. 

Video transcoding is used to change the original format into one allowing the video and audio to play properly on a user’s devices — be they computer, tablet, smartphone, or tv.
Video encoding, or video transcoding, involves a two-step process. \
First, the original file is decoded to an uncompressed format. \
Second, this uncompressed format is then encoded into the target format.

## What are Formats and File Types in Video Transcoding?
When talking about video transcoding, we refer to file formats, file types, and something called codecs.
- Video format specifies how video and audio have been combined and tells playback devices how to play the files.
- Video and audio codec formats refer to the technologies used to both create and play back the digital video and audio.

Examples of file types are MPEG-4 (MP4), Quicktime (MOV), and Flash Video (FLV). \
The key variable in most cases is the streaming platform you use. 

DaCast, for example, requires an MPEG-4 (MP4) file format with an H.264 video codec. \
Windows Media Video (WMV) files are Advanced Systems Format (.asf) files that include audio, video, or both compressed with Windows Media Audio (WMA) and Windows Media Video (WMV) codecs.  \
MP4 video provides better quality and compression over WMV, allowing you to store better quality video for the same file size. \
A good video transcoding program will be able to convert multiple file formats and codecs.
